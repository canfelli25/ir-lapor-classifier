# Lapor Classifier

Simple crawler and topic modelling for lapor.go.id equipped with react and D3.js front end for visualization. 

Since lapor.go.id do not have tags feature, this application purpose is to create relevant tags and to visualize the big picture of all lapor.go.id entries. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for the topic modelling.

Created as the fourth assignment of Information Retrieval course (IKO41357)
